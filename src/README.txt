A CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGE RANDOM SENTENCE GENERATOR

You can use this app to randomly generate your own sentences, so you can
learn about the Context-Free Language model that is the basis
for lots of programming languages, or just have fun making silly sentences!

To run the GUI, just run MyGUI from the command line and follow the
instructions as you see in the new window. You can mess around changing
the words in the grammar, or you can even update the grammar rules in the
advanced pane.

Credit for this default CFL goes to Michael Sipser's Theory of Computation
textbook. (It is also a very lucid and in-depth textbook on the CS theory,
so if you're looking for an enlightening read, check it out.)

Have fun!
